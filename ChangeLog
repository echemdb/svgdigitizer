* Added an option in the CLI to add an SVG template to the linked SVG file.

**Changed:**

* Changed version bound for pybtex from "">=0.24,<0.25" to ">=0.25,<0.26".
* Changed PDF handling from pdf2image to PyMuPDF, allowing to run in pyodide.

**Fixed:**

v0.12.5
====================

**Fixed:**

* Fixed uploading wheel.



v0.12.4
====================

**Added:**

* Added wheel upload on new release.



v0.12.3
====================

**Added:**

* Added tests for validating output datapackages against echemdb's svgdigitizer Data Package schema.

**Removed:**

* Removed key `data description` from output Data Package, since the information is included in the key `figure description`.



v0.12.2
====================

**Added:**

* Added testing with Python 3.13.



v0.12.1
====================

**Fixed:**

* Fixed dependency issue, by re-including `scipy` and `svg.path` (see [feedstock issue](https://github.com/conda-forge/svgdigitizer-feedstock/pull/21)).
* Fixed breaking tests on GitHub (tests should be more stable now since we switched to pixi for locked versions of dependencies.)



v0.12.0
====================

**Added:**

* Added testing with Python 3.12.

**Changed:**

* Use pyproject.toml to manage installation.

**Removed:**

* Removed unnecessary dependencies (`svg.path` and `scipy`).

**Fixed:**

* Fixed automated testing on GitHub with macOS.



v0.11.0
====================

**Added:**

* Improved the documentation with a large number of usage examples for the CLI, API and SVG annotation.

**Fixed:**

* Upgraded dependency on vulnerable version of pillow, see https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-j7hp-h8jx-5ppr. This possibly leads to an incompatibilities of `svgdigitizer` with Macos.



v0.10.0
====================

**Added:**

* Added CLI command `svgdigitzer figure` which allows creating a datapackage from a figure with units on the axis.

**Changed:**

* Changed structure of the output frictionless datapackage. The metadata are now included as custom key in the resource instead of being a top level key. Moved the "bibliography" key from top level to `metadata.source`.

**Removed:**

* Removed flag `--package` from the CLI and create datapackages by default.



v0.9.1
====================

**Added:**

* Digitizing with flag `--bibliography` creates a "bibliography key, which is an empty string when no citation key is given in `metadata["source"]["citation key"]` or no BIB file with the given citation key is available.



v0.9.0
====================

**Added:**

* Added flag `--citation` to the click command `cv`, which includes the content of a BIB file as bibtex string in a descriptor in the datapackage. The name to the BIB file must be provided in the metadata in `metadata['source']['bib']`.



v0.8.0
====================

**Added:**

* Added module `svgdigitizer.svgfigure.SVGFigure` to digitize custom figures (which are not CVs.)
* Added assertions to `svgdigitizer.electrochemistry.cv.CV`, such that only E or U (I or j) labels are allowed on the x-axis (y-axis).
* Added `scan_rate_labels` to `svgdigitizer.svgfigure`, returning the labels in the SVG with a scan rate.
* Added possibility to reconstruct a time axis, when a scan rate is provided in the plot, who's units match those of the x-axis.
* Added keyword `measurement_type` to `svgdigitizer.svgfigure.SVGFigure`, which will be added to the metadata.
* Added keyword `force_si_units` to `svgdigitizer.svgfigure.SVGFigure`, which allows transformation of a figure with units into SI units.
* Added flag `--si-units` to the `cv` command in the command line interface.

**Changed:**

* Changed `svgdigitizer.svgplot.SVGplot.schema` to `svgdigitizer.svgplot.SVGplot.figure_schema`.

**Removed:**

* Removed the following methods and properties from `svgdigitizer.electrochemistry.cv.CV` which were also not transferred to `svgdigitizer.svgfigure.SVGFigure`: `voltage_dimension`, `current_dimension`, `_add_voltage_axis`, and `_add_current_axis`.

**Fixed:**

* Fixed detection of `simultaneous measurement` in `electrochemistry.cv.CV`.



v0.7.0
====================

**Added:**

* Added custom exception classes to be more specific when errors are found in the input. Also fixes linter warnings with `pylint`>2.16.

**Changed:**

* Upgraded to frictionless 5.5.
* Changed formatting of JSON metadata files. A newline is now added automatically at the end of the file.
* Changed output format of JSON (datapackages) to produce indented JSON.

**Removed:**

* Removed `__main__.py` as the entrypoint. As a result, `python -m svgdigitizer` does not invoke the digitizer anymore. The digitizer can still be invoked with `svgdigitizer` once installed.

**Fixed:**

* Fixed detection of `simultaneous measurement` in `electrochemistry.cv.CV`.
* Fixed the alphabetical order of the dependencies in the environment.yml.
* Fixed doctesting of the command line interface, by moving the content from `__main__.py` to `entrypoint.py`.
* Fixed handling of unicode characters when writing JSON files. Unicode characters are now written as UTF-8 characters without escaping.



v0.6.1
====================

**Fixed:**

* Fixed garbage collection of instances with cached properties.
* Fixed an incompatibility of frictionless & click. (#152)
* Declared dependency on Python 3.9 when installing from PyPI (we use functools.cache which is not available before.)
* Restored changelog template.
* Fixed `svgplot.scaling_factors` such that scaling factors are now determined for any kind of axis dimension (so far only for axis labeled `x` or `y`).
* Fixed broken links in the documentation.
* Fixed Github workflow files.
* Fixed doctests according to module updates.



v0.6.0
====================

**Added:**

* Added a short documentation to the package svgdigitizer with some very basic usage examples with the CLI and API.
* Added Python version 3.9 as a requirement to setup.py and environment.yaml.

**Removed:**

* Removed class method `svgdigitizer.electrochemistry.cv.CV.get_axis_unit`.



v0.5.0
====================

**Added:**

* Added a property `schema` to `svgplot.SVGPlot`, describing the data extracted from the plot.
* Added a property `figure_schema`to `electrochemistry.cv.CV`, containing the original figure axis properties.
* Added a property `data_schema`to `electrochemistry.cv.CV`, containing the axis properties of the property `electrochemistry.cv.CV.df`.
* Added `voltage_dimension` and `current_dimension` to `electrochemistry.cv.CV`, providing the dimension of the voltage and the current.

**Changed:**

* Changed `electrochemistry.cv.CV` such that it only accepts SVGs where the labels on one axis are either `U` or `E` (V, mV, ...) and another axis are `I` (A, mA, ...) or `j` (A / cm2, uA / m2, ...).
* Changed `rate` to `scan_rate` in `electrochemistry.cv.CV`.

**Removed:**

* Removed `axis_properties` and `x_label` from `electrochemistry.cv.CV`.



v0.4.0
====================

**Added:**

* Added property `CV.tags`, `CV.figure_label`, and `CV.curve_label` which are extracted from `<text>` elements in the SVG. The extracted values are stored in `CV.metadata`.
* Added installation instructions.
* Added automatic symbol and orientation detection of axes.

**Changed:**

* Changed entry `axes` in `figure description` and `data description` to `field` according to `Frictionless Table Schema <https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/table-schema>`_.
* Replaced module `datapackage` with `frictionless`.

**Removed:**

* Removed `data description` in datapackage created with `digitize_cv`.

**Fixed:**

* Fixed data package creation in `__main__.digitize_cv`, where `data_description` was removed instead of `data_description.fields`.



v0.3.0
====================

**Added:**

* Added flag `--skewed` in the CLI to the commands `digitze` and `cv` to enable digitization of skewed plots (non-orthogonal axes).
* Added "Edit on GitHub" links to documentation.

**Fixed:**

* Fixed version number in title of generated documentation.
* Upgraded dependency on vulnerable version of pillow, see https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8vj2-vxx3-667w.



v0.2.0
====================

**Added:**

* Added the property `svgdigitizer.electrochemistry.cv.CV.simultaneous_measurement` which is read from a text field in the SVG file.

**Changed:**

* Changed the property `svgdigitizer.electrochemistry.cv.CV.metadata`. It now includes 'data description' which contains the units to the values in the dataframe.
* Changed the dimension on the x-axis of CVs from `U` to `E` (potential).



v0.1.2
====================

**Fixed:**

* Fixed version number in `setup.py` and thus on PyPI when releasing.



v0.1.1
====================

**Fixed:**

* Fixed description in `setup.py` to be compatible with PyPI.
