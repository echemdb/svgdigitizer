svgdigitizer Change Log
=======================

.. current developments

v0.6.1
====================

**Fixed:**

* Fixed garbage collection of instances with cached properties.
* Fixed an incompatibility of frictionless & click. (#152)
* Declared dependency on Python 3.9 when installing from PyPI (we use functools.cache which is not available before.)
* Restored changelog template.
* Fixed `svgplot.scaling_factors` such that scaling factors are now determined for any kind of axis dimension (so far only for axis labeled `x` or `y`).
* Fixed broken links in the documentation.
* Fixed Github workflow files.
* Fixed doctests according to module updates.



v0.6.0
====================

**Added:**

* Added a short documentation to the package svgdigitizer with some very basic usage examples with the CLI and API.
* Added Python version 3.9 as a requirement to setup.py and environment.yaml.

**Removed:**

* Removed class method `svgdigitizer.electrochemistry.cv.CV.get_axis_unit`.



v0.5.0
====================

**Added:**

* Added a property `schema` to `svgplot.SVGPlot`, describing the data extracted from the plot.
* Added a property `figure_schema`to `electrochemistry.cv.CV`, containing the original figure axis properties.
* Added a property `data_schema`to `electrochemistry.cv.CV`, containing the axis properties of the property `electrochemistry.cv.CV.df`.
* Added `voltage_dimension` and `current_dimension` to `electrochemistry.cv.CV`, providing the dimension of the voltage and the current.

**Changed:**

* Changed `electrochemistry.cv.CV` such that it only accepts SVGs where the labels on one axis are either `U` or `E` (V, mV, ...) and another axis are `I` (A, mA, ...) or `j` (A / cm2, uA / m2, ...).
* Changed `rate` to `scan_rate` in `electrochemistry.cv.CV`.

**Removed:**

* Removed `axis_properties` and `x_label` from `electrochemistry.cv.CV`.



v0.4.0
====================

**Added:**

* Added property `CV.tags`, `CV.figure_label`, and `CV.curve_label` which are extracted from `<text>` elements in the SVG. The extracted values are stored in `CV.metadata`.
* Added installation instructions.
* Added automatic symbol and orientation detection of axes.

**Changed:**

* Changed entry `axes` in `figure description` and `data description` to `field` according to `Frictionless Table Schema <https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/table-schema>`_.
* Replaced module `datapackage` with `frictionless`.

**Removed:**

* Removed `data description` in datapackage created with `digitize_cv`.

**Fixed:**

* Fixed data package creation in `__main__.digitize_cv`, where `data_description` was removed instead of `data_description.fields`.



v0.3.0
====================

**Added:**

* Added flag `--skewed` in the CLI to the commands `digitze` and `cv` to enable digitization of skewed plots (non-orthogonal axes).
* Added "Edit on GitHub" links to documentation.

**Fixed:**

* Fixed version number in title of generated documentation.
* Upgraded dependency on vulnerable version of pillow, see https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8vj2-vxx3-667w.



v0.2.0
====================

**Added:**

* Added the property `svgdigitizer.electrochemistry.cv.CV.simultaneous_measurement` which is read from a text field in the SVG file.

**Changed:**

* Changed the property `svgdigitizer.electrochemistry.cv.CV.metadata`. It now includes 'data description' which contains the units to the values in the dataframe.
* Changed the dimension on the x-axis of CVs from `U` to `E` (potential).



v0.1.2
====================

**Fixed:**

* Fixed version number in `setup.py` and thus on PyPI when releasing.



v0.1.1
====================

**Fixed:**

* Fixed description in `setup.py` to be compatible with PyPI.
